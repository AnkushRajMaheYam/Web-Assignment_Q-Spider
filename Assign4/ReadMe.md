## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML
For make this Table I use only HTML.

## Optimizations
It's not better optimize in other devices, it made only the use of html. But Table was optimize by using some html table keywords like :- rowspan, boder, rule, cellpadding etc.

## Lessons Learned:
# Table :-
It is collection of rows and columns.

Table is grid oragnised in rows and columns much like in spreadsheet.

To create table in html, we use <table></table> tag.

Here we are crating table row by row.
To create Table row we use <tr></tr> tag.
To create cells html provide 2 tags.
1. <th></th> tag: It is used  to create Table Heading cells.
2. <td></td> tag: It is used to create Table data Cells.

To provide title or caption to the table we use <caption></caption> tag.

caption tag we have to write within <table></table> tag.

# Cell Spanning :- 

In html, we have 2 ways to span the cells 

1. Rowspan :- rowspan is an attribute used to span the cells on row basis.

2. Colspan :- Colspan is an attribute used to span the cells on colunm basis.

# Attributes of Table Tag:

1. Border :- It is used to create border around the table.

2. Cellpadding :- It is used to create space inside the cell.

3. cellspacing :- It is used to crate space outside the cell.

4. rules :- all;


# Thead Tag :-

The top mmost part of our table wwe have to write within <thead></thead> tag.

# Tfoot tag:-

The bottom most part of our table we have to write within <tfoot></tfoot> tag.

# Tboday Tag :

Remaning content of our table we have to write within <tbody></tbody> tag.

# note :- 
Thread, Tbody and Tfoot tag are highly recommended to use inside a table for better explanation and crawler understanding purpose.
